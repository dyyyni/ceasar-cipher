# ceasar-cipher
I'm completing a security protocols course that has tasks to 
implement different protocols. This my take on Caesar cipher.

## Usage
Clone the repository to your computer.
```git clone git@github.com:dyyyni/ceasar-cipher.git```

Navigate to the project directory.

Commands:

To encrypt

```python3 main.py -e```

To decrypt

```python3 main.py -d```

To brute force the decryption

```python3 main.py -b```

You can also feed in text files like this:

```python3 main.py -b < crypt.txt```
